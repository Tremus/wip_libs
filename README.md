# WIPs

Big bag of my unfinished libs that live in one folder. They're used by several of my private projects and I need a way to keep them all in sync. When the libs are 'complete' they will probably move to another repo.

This is made public because there are a few real gems among them. Some are basically finished (haven't been changed in a year) but I'm too busy to polish them. Others are in active development.

I will make little to no attempt to describe them. If you're interested read & take what you like and GLWTS. Many of the libs depend on other public libs found in my github.
